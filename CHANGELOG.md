## [Unreleased]

_Nothing yet._

## [0.1.2] — 2026-07-08

### Changed

- **Daemon stop now includes session workers.** v0.1.1 stopped only the daemon
  supervisor (`--keep-workers`), but a kept worker holds in memory the account
  it was started under — so `claude --resume` reattached to the old worker and
  the switch appeared to have no effect (the resumed session kept the previous
  org). The switch now runs `claude daemon stop --any` (no `--keep-workers`), so
  every subsequent session, resumed or fresh, picks up the switched account.
  Trade-off: switching ends any detached background Claude Code sessions.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-07-08

### Fixed

- **Daemon-aware switching** — recent Claude Code releases keep a background
  daemon running that caches each account's auth in memory, so a profile switch
  did not take effect until the daemon exited. Every switch (`use` and the bare
  `ccswitch <name>` form) now stops the daemon's supervisor first via `claude
  daemon stop --any --keep-workers`, so the next session re-reads the restored
  credentials while any detached background sessions keep running. It is
  best-effort: an older Claude Code, a missing binary, or no running daemon
  never blocks the switch (a warning is printed and the switch proceeds).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-08

First release of the Rust CLI, superseding the original fish plugin (now under
`legacy-fish/`).

### Added

- **Account switching** — `save`, `use`, and the bare `ccswitch <name>
  [args...]` form snapshot both halves of a Claude Code identity (the OAuth
  credential and the `~/.claude.json` `oauthAccount` + `userID`) into a plain
  profile directory and restore them as a unit, launching `claude` on the bare
  form.
- **`add`** — sign in to a new account (`claude auth login`) and save it in one
  step; `--force` on `add`/`save` overwrites an existing profile.
- **`list`, `current`, `rm`** — enumerate profiles (`*` marks the active one),
  show the active account, and delete a profile; with aliases `ls`, `whoami`,
  and `remove`/`delete`.
- **Token-rotation fix** — on every switch the outgoing credential is
  re-snapshotted into **every** profile that shares its per-account refresh
  token (`TokenScope::PerAccount`), so an actively used account never strands a
  sibling profile with a rotated-out token.
- **Concurrent sessions** — `isolate` runs a session under a per-profile
  `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` with `projects/`, `history.jsonl`, and `CLAUDE.md`
  symlinked to a shared directory, and `seed` imports that shared memory from
  `~/.claude` (or a given dir). Empty shared memory triggers a confirm.
- **`search`** — bridges to [`csx`](https://github.com/mysqto/csx) + `fzf` to
  fuzzy-pick and resume a past session, defaulting the scope to the active tool
  and resuming with the right command per tool (`claude`, `codex`).
- **Cross-shell completions** — `completions <shell>` for bash, zsh, fish,
  PowerShell, and elvish.
- **Cross-platform credentials** — macOS Keychain via the `security` binary,
  with a `~/.claude/.credentials.json` file store fallback elsewhere.
- **Docs & distribution** — README, `AGENTS.md`, a GitHub release workflow with
  a cross-compile matrix, and an auto-bumped Homebrew cask.

### Notes

- Test suite covers decision logic to ≥98% line and region; OS/network I/O
  lives in `*_shim.rs` files behind traits (see `AGENTS.md`).
